<p id="about" style="margin-left:20"><br  size="2"> <B>What is about leaf senescence and LSD?</B><br><br>
        Leaf senescence has been recognized as the last phase of plant development, a highly ordered process regulated by genes called SAGs. Premature senescence leads to the reduced yield of crops and this is likely to be of increasing concern in the time of climate changing and population growth. Therefore, it might be expected that more researches will focus on this important topic in the future, because increased understanding of the senescence process can help people improve the yield of crops. At present, many researches about leaf senescence have been done in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, however, how the leaf senescence process is initiated and regulated remains largely unknown, especially for other species. Luckily, with the rapid development of sequencing technology, more and more plant genomes have been sequenced, which offers us a great opportunity to analyze the homologous genes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> SAGs in other species.
        <br><br>By integrating the data from mutant studies and transgenic analysis, we collected many SAGs related to regulation of the leaf senescence in various species, as is shown in <a href="browsespecies_by_tree.php"><b>Species Tree</b></a>. This database can facilitate studies in the leaf senescence community.
        <br><br>Another characteristics of this database is that we have categorized SAGs according to their functions in regulation of leaf senescence and used standard criteria to describe senescence associated phenotypes for mutants.<br/><br/>

<p id="PSTL" style="margin-left:20"><font  size="2"> <B>What is about the group of Hongwei Guo?</B><br><br>
The group of Hongwei Guo is called <a href="http://www.bio.pku.edu.cn/lab/guohw_lab/index.html"  target="_blank"><b>Plant Signal Transduction Lab</b></a>, which focuses on the signal transduction of phytohormones, cross-talking and interplays between internal hormones signal cascades and environmental signaling in plant development, senescence and stress responses. This lab is interested in revealing the molecular mechanisms of ethylene signal pathway regulating leaf senescence, and dissecting the signal pathway of leaf senescence in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and in Poplar.

<p  id="CBI" style="margin-left:20"><font  size="2"> <B>What is about CBI?</B><br><br>
The Centre for Bioinformatics (<a href="http://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><b>CBI</b></a>) is the first bioinformatics center in China founded in 1996. CBI is located in the New Life Sciences Building of Peking University, which has several computing labs with strong computer hardware and software facilities and a molecular biology lab. While continuing to maintain the first and largest online bioinformatics resource in China as China's official national node of EMBnet, CBI has published abundance of papers in various of research areas, such as gene expression regulation, genome analysis and pathway networks. CBI is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, and Natural Science Foundation of China.
