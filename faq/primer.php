<p style="margin-left:20px"><font  size="2"> 
To help researchers study the expression level of their interested SAGs, primer sequences retrieved from research papers or designed by <a href='http://www.premierbiosoft.com/' target='_blank'><b>Array Designer 4</b></a> are provided in LSD. You can search for them via Text Search.<br></br> 
To facilitate the conduction of multiple PCRs, primers designed with Array Designer 4 are all in considering of the following properties:<br/></br>
1. Primers are 19~23 nucleotides long, with a preferred length of 21 nucleotides. This is long enough to permit gene-specific primers, while reducing the potential for cross-reactivity and allowing cost-effective generation of large primer sets.<br/>
2. The GC contents are 35%~65% to ensure uniform priming.<br/>
3. Since PCR efficiency is decreased for very long amplicons, only short amplicons of 150~450 nucleotides are considered during primer selection. Occasionally, if this requirement cannot be satisfied, a wider range of 100~700 nucleotides is adopted.
